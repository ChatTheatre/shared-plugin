# The Shared Project

[]{.twiki-macro .TOC}

## Summary

The Shared project is an attempt to create an ever-growing repository of
shared things, from clothing to consumables (food and drinks) to
furniture or entire systems. Great emphasis is placed on **quality** of
the shared content, and for this reason a lot of effort has gone into
making it as easy as possible to ensure the quality of shared objects.
To further improve the cooperation between games, a new sync system is
being introduced into SkotOS, called Sync 2.0, which enables anyone from
any game to provide and patch content from their local games, and to
then sync their changes out to the rest of the world.
