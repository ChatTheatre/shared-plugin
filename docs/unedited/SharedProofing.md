# The Proofing System

[]{.twiki-macro .TOC}

## Introduction

The proofing system was created to make it as easy and convenient as
possible to proof shared (and non-shared) objects in the SkotOS
environment. The proofing system is a set of panes in a dynamically
generated web page which present the proofer with various aspects of an
object. The system not only displays the content, but auto-detects
potential issues and errors, and informs or advices the user about these
issues.
